# Spatial Interpolation Lib by Pablo Alfaro (pabloalfaropineyro@gmail.com) #
############################################################################
# A complete library for performing spatial interpolation on space time    #
# series data                                                              #
# Allows incorporation of gridded auxiliary fields to assist on            #
# interpolation modelling via techniques from the Regression Kriging family#
# as well as provides functionalities for plotting and storing the results.#
# This library was developed as the graduation project for the author's    #
# Masters Degree on Mathematical Engineering                               #
